summary: "This post is the default <a href='http://jekyllrb.com' target='_blank'>jekyll</a> 
post you get after installing Jekyll.
I've left this here to show I used jekyll. And also so how easy it was for me to 
build this page in a day(-12 hrs)."

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight linenos%}
