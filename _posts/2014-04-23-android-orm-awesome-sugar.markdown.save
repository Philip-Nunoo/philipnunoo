<p>
<h1>Download Sugar</h1>
You could actually download sugar as a .jar file or a library and
include it in your android project.
</p>

<p>
I choose not to speak for satyan the creator of sugar. But from what I 
see sugar chooses to mimick ORM is played in Rails which makes me very excited.
Cause I'm falling in love with Rails and their migrations.
</p>

<p>
<h1>Configuration</h1>
One nice thing I realized with sugar is their way they handle everything, 
taking away all the coding which needs to be done in setting up or creating
an Sqlite database and its associated table and field. 
<p>
Ok so this is the configuration done within your AndroidManifest.xml
Just include "android:name=com.orm.SugarApp" in your application tag.

And add some few meta-data tag in your application tag to get it started.
</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<application android:label="@string/app_name" android:icon="@drawable/icon"
android:name="com.orm.SugarApp">
.
.
<meta-data android:name="DATABASE" android:value="sugar_example.db" />
<meta-data android:name="VERSION" android:value="2" />
<meta-data android:name="QUERY_LOG" android:value="true" />
<meta-data android:name="DOMAIN_PACKAGE_NAME" android:value="com.example" />
.
.
</application>
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
<p>
<h1>
meta-data tags</h1>
